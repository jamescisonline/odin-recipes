    <h2>What others are saying about this receipe</h2>
    <p>Great textures, combination of items and taste. My daughter especially liked it, as she is 
        into all food that is Mexican or Southwestern. Saw that some on here have mentioned that this
         recipes is full of carbs. It does have lots of carbs, but they are healthy ones. This recipe
          contains healthy, complex carbohydrates like beans and avocados, which we all need to have 
          healthy, balanced diets and that provide energy; we should avoid simple carbs, like pretzels,
           white bread, donuts, lots of types of candies, pies, etc. are the types that turn to pure 
           sugar once eaten and</p>
    <p>When I first saw this recipe come out in the new published recipe list, I just knew I'd like it,
         has everything in it I love. Finally had a chance to make it. Nice southwestern breakfast that 
         is easy to make, healthy and will keep you satisfied all day long. Thanks Matt for such a great
          idea for breakfast.</p>
