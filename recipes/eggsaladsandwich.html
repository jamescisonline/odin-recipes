    <h2>What others are saying about this receipe</h2>
    <p>Wonderful recipe starting with a good base that is great "as is" or with additions. The ratio of 
        egg/mayo/mustard are perfect in this. I have had this twice. The first try was just as the recipe 
        states and the second time I added a little celery and dill. Both times were very good! I will be 
        making this again! Thank you for sharing your recipe!</p>
    <p>Perfect...... after some tweaking. I hate when people drastically change recipes, but I couldnt find
         anything on here with all the KEY ingredients for great egg salad. This recipe had a great start. I 
         just added some finely diced celery for crunch, 1 tsp dill weed (gotta have dill in your egg salad 
         sandwich), 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of the green onions (didnt have any on hand) and used dijon 
         mustard for a little more flavor. Turned out great, I ate half of it before it even made it to the 
         fridge for lunch the next day.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped green onion</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place egg in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove
             from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, 
             cool, peel and chop.</li>
        <li>Place the chopped eggs in a bowl, and stir in the mayonnaise, mustard and green onion. Season 
            with salt, pepper and paprika. Stir and serve on your favorite bread or crackers.</li>
