    <h2>What others are saying about this receipe</h2>
    <p>I love the base of this recipe but when made as is, it was too thin and stiff from too much spinach. 
        I made it as written the first time and ended up with a very stiff, thin, dry spinach pie. I have 
        continued to use this recipe so to speak, but have since used 5 large eggs, only about 1/2 to 2/3 
        of the spinach called for, chopped bell peppers and 1/4 cup milk, and only 2 cups of cheese 
        (I usually use cheddar). Other add-ins I have used with fantastic results - 1/2 cup cottage cheese
         in place of cheese, 1/2 cooked chopped bacon or ham, 1 can diced green chilies, choppe</p>
    <p>Yummy! I didn't use muenster cheese. Instead, to make this lower fat, I used 3 eggs, 1/2 cup 
        light sharp cheddar, 1 cup fat free cottage cheese, and a 1/4 cup light parmesan cheese. I 
        added a few sliced mushrooms and green onion in the saute. Although not as rich, still tasty
         and forgiving recipe.</p>
